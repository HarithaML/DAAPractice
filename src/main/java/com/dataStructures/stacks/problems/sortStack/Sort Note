1. Add the first top element of stack1 to stack2
2. Compare the top of stack1 with top of stack2
3. if top of stack1 is less than top of stack2
    1. put it in a variable and pop
    2. push all the elements of stack2 greater than top to stack1
    3.push the variable to stack2
    continue compare
4. if top of stack1 is more than top of stack2
    1. push to stack2
    continue compare
